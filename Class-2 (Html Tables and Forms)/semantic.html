          The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated
          descendant of the gray wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it was
          selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late
          Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be
          domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the
          development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans,
          dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that
          would be inadequate for other canids.
